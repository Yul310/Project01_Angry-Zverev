# Angry Zverev


## Premise:
Alexander Zverev who is current world ranking no.3 is really mad after losing a US open final game. He started to hit balls out of anger and do you think you can avoid all the balls? His forehand is very powerful so if you get one hit, you are out. I hope you can avoid all of his forehands for 1 mins. FYI, his top spin shots change directions suddenly so be careful. Click on the link below if you wonder how angry he can be.
