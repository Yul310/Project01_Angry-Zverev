## Premise:
Alexander Zverev who is current world ranking no.3 is really mad after losing a US open final game. He started to hit balls out of anger and do you think you can avoid all the balls? His forehand is very powerful so if you get one hit, you are out. I hope you can avoid all of his forehands for 1 mins. FYI, his top spin shot changes direction suddenly so be careful. Click on the link below if you wonder how angry he can be.

## User Story
If I open the page, you can see simple animation and you can proceed to the tutorial page by clicking a button.
Simple tutorial animation is going to be played and I can test how I can move the player with ARROW keys and how I can make the player dodge the balls.
If I hit ENTER key, the game is going to be started. 
The game is going to be more difficult as I am playing. 
After certain time, Zverev is going to hit curve balls.
If I can survive for 30 seconds, I win but I can keep playing for the record.(Time)
If I got a hit, the gameover message is going to be displayed and I can start the game again
by hitting SPACE key.
